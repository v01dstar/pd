// This file defines the type GCStateManager is the core for managing states of TiKV's GC for MVCC data. The
// implementation is based on the endpoint.GCStateProvider interface (and should be the only user of
// endpoint.GCStateProvider) for reading and storing persistent data, and provides a set of primitives (APIs) for
// reading and operating GC states, directly handling a set of corresponding gRPC APIs.
//
// Explanations of concepts mentioned in this file (here the term `snapshots` means snapshots of TiKV's MVCC data,
// represented by a timestamp):
//
//   - GC Safe Point: A timestamp, the snapshots before which can be safely discarded by GC. Written by the GCWorker
//     to control the GC procedure.
//   - Txn Safe Point / Transaction Safe Point: A timestamp, the snapshots equal to or after which can be safely read.
//     Written by the GCWorker to control the GC procedure.
//   - GC Barriers: Blocks GC from advancing the txn safe point over some specific timestamps (the barrierTS of these
//     barriers), ensures snapshots equal to or after which to be safe to read. GC barriers can be set by any components
//     in the cluster.
//   - Service Safe Points / Service GC Safe Points: Another mechanism that has the same purpose as GC barriers, but
//     is planned to be deprecated in favor of GC barriers. However, in order to keep the backward compatibility of the
//     persistent data, the data structure of service safe points is still used internally to represent GC barriers.
//     Service safe points can also be set by any components in the cluster.
//   - TiDB Min StartTS: A TiDB nodes in versions (in which the new GC API defined in this file is not being used) can
//     write a special key into PD's etcd by directly calling the etcd client API to store the minimum start ts among
//     all sessions in the TiDB node. TiDB's GCWorker module will load these keys to block GC's advancement. It will
//     be deprecated and replaced with GC barriers, but for compatibility, if there are such keys, it's still functional
//     to block the txn safe point from advancing.
//
// GC management may differ between different keyspaces. There are two kinds of GC management, each of which has
// a different path to write its metadata in etcd:
//
//   - Keyspace-level: A keyspace manages its GC by itself, and have independent GC states from other keyspaces.
//   - Unified: Keyspaces not configured to use keyspace-level GC are running unified GC. The NullKeyspace (which is
//     used when a TiDB node are not configured to use any keyspace) is always running unified GC. For all keyspaces
//     running unified GC, the GC states are shared and uniformly managed by the NullKeyspace.
//
// As the core implementation of GC states calculation, GCStateManager is responsible for maintaining a set of
// constraints among the properties in the GC states. The constraints are as follows:
//
//  1. The txn safe point must never decrease (`t' >= t`).
//  2. The GC safe point must never decrease (`g' >= g`).
//  3. It's always held that GC safe point <= txn safe point (`g <= t`).
//  4. For each GC barrier `b`, txn safe point <= b.BarrierTS (`t <= b.BarrierTS` for b in GC barriers).
//  5. For each TiDB min start ts `m` (if there is any), each advancement of the txn safe point should not push it to a
//     new value that is larger than `m` (`t' <= max{t, min(M)}` where `M` is the set of all TiDB min startTSs).
//
// Note that the item 5 implies that if there is a TiDB min start ts `m` such that `m` is less than the current txn
// safe point, then the txn safe point should keep its previous place when trying to advance it. It should neither go
// forward nor backward. This case is possible because when TiDB nodes in previous versions write its min start ts to
// etcd, it won't check other properties in the GC states. Neither is it done in an etcd transaction to prevent
// other concurrent read/write operations to the GC states, so it's even not atomic. What we can do is to keep it as
// safe as possible.
//
// Also note that the item 4 listed above can also be weakened. In most cases, the constraint can be held correctly;
// however, there can be exceptions considering the procedure during rolling upgrades or downgrading. In previous
// version of PD, only the GC barriers (as its predecessor, the service safe points) are managed by PD, while the other
// properties are not; and it updates service safe points without the protection of etcd transactions (it only uses a
// mutex). Considering leader changes, two `UpdateServiceGCSafePoint` operations is theoretically possible to be run
// concurrently, leading to a result that a new service safe point is less than the safe point of the next GC.
// From the perspective of the new GCStateManager, it constructs a case where the txn safe point > a GC barrier.
// When this happens, it works like how it handles the TiDB min startTSs that is less than the txn safe point:
// the txn safe point will be neither advanced nor decreased. Thus, here's a downgraded version of the item 4 in the
// above constraints:
//
//  4. (weakened) For each GC barrier `b`, each advancement of the txn safe point should not push it to a new value
//     that is larger than `b.BarrierTS` (`t' <= max{t, min(b.BarrierTS for b in B)}` where `B` is the set of GC
//     barriers).
//
// TODO: Explicitly state the versions that GCStateManager starts to be functional and the old APIs/concepts/terms is
//       deprecated when these work are all done.

// GCStateManager is the manager for all kinds of states of TiKV's GC for MVCC data.

// CompatibleUpdateServiceGCSafePoint updates the service safe point of the given serviceID. Service safe points are
// being deprecated, and this method provides compatibility for components that are still using service safe point API.
// This method simulates the behavior of the service safe points in old versions, by internally using txn safe points
// and GC barriers. The behaviors are mapped as follows:
//
//   - The service safe point with service ID "gc_worker" is mapped to the txn safe point.
//   - The service safe point with other service IDs are mapped to GC barriers with barrier IDs equal to the given
//     service IDs.
//
// Note that the behavior of the service safe point of "gc_worker" is NOT perfectly the same as before: it can no longer
// be advanced over other service safe points, but will be blocked by the minimal one; and if the cluster was running
// with TiDB node that haven't migrated to the new GC APIs, it can also be blocked by the *TiDB min start ts* written by
// those TiDB nodes.
//
// Therefore, the method's behavior is as follows:
//
//  1. If the given serviceID is "gc_worker", it internally calls AdvanceTxnSafePoint.
//     - If the advancing result is the same as newServiceSafePoint, it's the case that the updated service safe
//     point of "gc_worker" is exactly the minimal one. Returns a simulated service safe point with the service ID
//     equals to "gc_worker".
//     - Otherwise, it's the case that the service safe point of "gc_worker" is successfully updated, but it's not
//     the minimal service safe point. Returns a simulated service safe point whose serviceID starts with
//     "tidb_min_start_ts_" to simulate the minimal service safe point. It may actually be either a GC barrier or
//     a *TiDB min start ts*.
//  2. If the given serviceID is anything else, it internally calls SetGCBarrier or DeleteGCBarrier, depending on
//     whether the `ttl` is positive or not. As the txn safe point is always less or equal to any GC barriers, we
//     simulate the case that the service safe point of "gc_worker" is the minimal one, and return a service safe point
//     with the service ID equals to "gc_worker".
//
